# TF-IDF Naive Bayes Text Classification

## Overview
This project implements a text classification pipeline using TF-IDF
vectorization and a Naive Bayes classifier.

## Why Naive Bayes?
Naive Bayes is well-suited for text classification tasks due to its
efficiency on high-dimensional sparse data and strong baseline performance.

## Pipeline
- Text preprocessing
- TF-IDF feature extraction
- Naive Bayes classification
- Model evaluation using confusion matrix
- Accuracy Score

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- Kraggle Notebook

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Open the notebook
3. Run all cells sequentially
